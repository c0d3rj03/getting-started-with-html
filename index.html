My Notes<br>
Stage 0<br>
Lesson 1
</b></p>

<b>HTML</b><br>
<p>
It was invented in the 1990's. <br>
This stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <br>
It is what browsers interpret when showing web pages.</p>

<b>Tags</b><br>
<p>
This is part of the hidden language.<br>
Learned various types of tags such as:<br>
<b>- b for bold</b><br>
<em>- em for italics</em>
</p>
<p>
The "a" tag is an attribute tag.<br>
<br>
Right now, we learned how to give a hyperlink as part of an attribute (using href). Such as:<br>
<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KFLDAVIE6#history"> My Weather Data on Weather Underground</a>
</p>
Most tags have content.<br>
<br>
<b>Newlines</b><br>
<p>
Just pressing enter to start a new line in an HTML file will not cause a newline to appear. Must use a tag to cause a newline to be created by the browser. A few different ways learned:<br>
- "br" will cause a newline break<br>
- p and /p will also do that.<br>
</p>
<b>Void tags</b><br>
<p>
As noticed with b and /b and others, most tags need a corresponding end tag. If that doesn't appear, then the tag interpreted by the browser will continue in that manner.<br>
<br>
Void tags are tags that have no content, thus do not need an end tag. "br" is an example because a "/br" isn't needed.
</p>
<b>Inline versus Block</b><br>
<p>
Block elements will actually create an invisible box that can be formatted with additional attributes.<br>
<br>
Inline elements simply will just cause a character entry.<br>
<br>
Examples of block are p and div.<br>
<br>
Also, learned that<br> 
- strong tag works like b.<br> 
- form seems like a block element like p and div.<br>
